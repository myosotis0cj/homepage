        <h2><strong>short introduction</h2></strong>
        <div class="mt-3">
        <p>Hello, I'm Alex, a sophomore student in China. Though my university is rather unremarkable, I find myself deeply uninterested in its official curriculum. Consequently, I’ve been dedicated to self-learning practical skills online, and I am currently immersed in the CS50 course.

My limited English proficiency presents significant challenges. For instance, the machine-translated subtitles for the course material are often difficult to decipher, and having to constantly fixate on subtitles adds considerable cognitive load to my studies. Furthermore, navigating many English resource websites often leaves me completely bewildered.

My current strategy for improvement is simply to watch, practice, and ask more questions. Regrettably, I lack a dedicated study partner. However, thanks to the advancements in AI, I primarily turn to ChatGPT and Gemini for assistance whenever I encounter difficulties.

These tools have resolved many of my immediate problems and cleared up my confusion. I am now committed to diligently improving my English proficiency, aiming to prepare for exams like the IELTS or TOEFL. Conquering CS and achieving a high level of English competence are my primary short-term goals.

        <h2 class="text-primary">My thoughts,Values and long term plan</h2>
        <p>My long-term aspiration is to emigrate to a developed, civilized nation. I've specifically considered Japan as a target, investing nine months during my freshman year to successfully achieve the JLPT N2 Japanese language certification.

While the path to Japan might not be successful, I remain open to exploring alternative plans. My inclination toward emigration stems from a perception that China is retreating socially, becoming more insulated, and experiencing a slowdown in economic growth. However, I believe these societal observations are secondary to the true concerns.

The genuine reasons are twofold. Firstly, I find life in China to be intensely taxing and exhausting. The average citizen is likely to bear a lifetime of immense pressure, from the moment they enter school until death. This burden is compounded by relatively high taxation that funds grossly inadequate social welfare, poor labor protections, and the threat of exploitation by unrestrained power. Despite decades of substantial economic growth, the common populace has only received a marginal share of this prosperity.

Secondly, I am deeply concerned by the escalating cross-strait tensions and the risk of a potential invasion of Taiwan by China. Should such an invasion occur, life for ordinary citizens would become exponentially more difficult. Furthermore, I feel a strong moral opposition: remaining in the country for even a second would fill me with guilt, as I would be indirectly financing a nation that is invading another.
