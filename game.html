        <h2 class="text_primary">1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
<!-- 荒野大镖客2是我接触的第二个3A游戏，也是让我印象最深刻的游戏之一，他的开放世界，令人沉浸的代入感是这个游戏的特色之一-->
<!-- 主线流程量大管饱，你将扮演游戏主角亚瑟摩根作为在美国的19世纪末期的黑帮亡命徒面对法治时代的洪流，我不得不说，在游戏的故事中:-->
<!-- 我感受到了人性的温情，家庭一样的范德林德帮，时代下努力生存的普通人，和其他亡命徒不一样，我们还留存着作为人的人性，在生离死别之际，行善，拯救他人，获得救赎-->
<!-- 游戏里传达的每一丝情感都深深地打动我,游戏的物理细节也是强的离谱，比如马匹的睾丸会热胀冷缩等等，仿佛就让我真正置身于19世纪末的美国当中-->

                    <p>"RDR2 is one of the most impactful games I’ve ever encountered. The open world isn't just a map; it is a masterclass in immersion.
            The main storyline is massive and rich. Playing as Arthur Morgan, you face the end of the outlaw era as the crushing weight of modern law descends upon the 19th century. What struck me most was the humanity within the chaos. The Van der Linde gang was a family, full of ordinary souls fighting to survive. We weren't just cold-blooded killers; we retained our souls. Amidst the tragedy of parting and death, we performed acts of benevolence and found true redemption.
            The emotional resonance of this game is unmatched, and the physics are simply insane—right down to the minute details of how horses react to the weather. It didn't feel like playing a game; it felt like living in 1899."</p>

      <!--只狼:影逝二度严格意义上来说是我接触的一款魂游，很多年前就发行的游戏，当时十分爆火，我看了下相关的视频感觉特别难，再加上当时作为初中生的我没什么钱购买 -->
      <!--直到最近几年才入手了这个游戏，一开始我感觉扮演主角狼的我谁都打不过，敌人的数值和我根本不是一个级别，但渐渐熟悉弹反和垫布之后，大多数小兵就变得很好对付了-->
      <!--游戏的主角狼作为角色平田九郎的忍者守护九郎，而九郎有着龙胤之血有着起死回生之力，九郎被苇名弦一郎抓走为他的不死之力，拯救摇摇欲坠的苇名国-->
      <!--而不死之力却是一种充满诅咒的力量，起死回生所需要的能量是消耗他人的生命为代价的，作为主角的我们要战胜一路上遇到的强敌，拯救九郎，并且消除龙胤之力-->
      <!--游戏剧情相对简单易懂，游戏引导也相对良好，我几乎不用看攻略，就能做完主线流程，而这游戏最出色的就是其战斗系统，再面对强敌，boss的时候-->
      <!--一开始作为玩家的我们似乎毫无还手之力，但再一次次的死亡与尝试中，我们熟悉了boss的攻击节奏，boss的攻击招式，一步一步的见招拆招，根据boss的攻击节奏识破并弹反他们的攻击-->
      <!--伴随着一阵阵的刀剑碰撞声之后，我们最终战胜boss，游戏的动作也设计的十分帅气，战斗场景也特别有意境，天守阁，朱雀桥，芦苇地都是别有用心的设计-->
      <!--接下来我会具体介绍一些经典的情节-->
      <p>Strictly speaking, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was my introduction to the 'Souls-like' genre. When it exploded onto the scene years ago, I was just a middle schooler with empty pockets. I remember watching gameplay videos, awestruck by its brutal difficulty yet unable to experience it myself.

It wasn't until recently that I finally picked up the blade. At first, stepping into the shoes of the protagonist, 'Wolf,' I felt powerless—the enemies seemed to exist in a league far above my own. But as I gradually mastered the rhythm of deflecting and dodging, the soldiers that once threatened me became nothing more than minor obstacles.

As Wolf, you are sworn to protect the Divine Heir, Kuro. Kuro bears the Dragon Heritage, a bloodline granting the power of resurrection. This power is coveted by Genichiro Ashina, who captures the young lord, intending to use his undying blood to save the crumbling nation of Ashina. Yet, this immortality is a cursed blessing; the energy required to rise from the dead comes at the cost of others' lives. Our journey is one of severing this cycle. We must carve a path through formidable foes to rescue Kuro and extinguish the Dragon Heritage.

Unlike its often cryptic peers, the narrative here is lucid, and the guidance intuitive—I completed the main story without once needing a walkthrough. But the game's true crown jewel is its combat. When facing a boss, we initially feel helpless. Yet, through the cycle of death and rebirth, we learn. We memorize their rhythm, decipher their moves, and counter every strike. It becomes a deadly dance of 'clashing steel,' where we read the flow of battle and deflect with precision.

Accompanied by the ringing sound of swords colliding, we finally seize victory. The movements are stylish and sharp, set against backdrops dripping with atmosphere—the towering Ashina Castle, the Vermilion Bridge, and the moonlit field of silvergrass are all meticulously designed.

Next, allow me to guide you through some of the most iconic moments...

    <h3>Classic Moment I: The Duel atop Ashina Castle</h3>
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>After the initial loss in the opening field, the journey led us back to the heart of the country. Standing atop the Ashina Castle lookout, we faced Genichiro again. But defeating him once was not enough. He stood back up, proclaiming his resolve to use any power necessary to protect his homeland.

He cast aside his armor for the final duel. The weather shifted instantly into a raging tempest, setting the stage for his desperate struggle. The visual impact was intense, pushing the tension to its absolute peak. His signature move in this phase, the 'Lightning of Tomoe,' was a nightmare to deal with before mastering the 'Lightning Reversal' mechanic. But once I internalized the rhythm, I finally overcame this powerful adversary.

<h3>Classic Scene 2: The Confrontation with the Divine Dragon</h3>

  <div class="col-md-6">

      <p>Our journey ultimately led us to the Fountainhead Palace, the mystical source of the Dragon Heritage and the dwelling place of the Divine Dragon. To sever the chains of immortality, we had to challenge this deity and obtain its tears.

The stage was set high above the clouds, a realm of pure fantasy. The Divine Dragon loomed before us, wielding the colossal Seven-Branched Sword. We took to the skies, harnessing the lightning and redirecting it back at the beast through 'Lightning Reversal.' This battle was not defined by punishing difficulty, but by its breathtaking cinematic spectacle—a visual masterpiece.

<h3>The Climactic Finale: Isshin, the Sword Saint </h3>
<h3>Classic Moment III: Genichiro’s Sacrifice and the Duel with Isshin</h3>
<div class="col-md-6">
  <p>In the final, desperate push, Genichiro seized the 'Open Gate' Mortal Blade and captured Kuro, intending to forcibly extract the Dragon Heritage. We intercepted him on the fateful Silvergrass Field, the very place where our journey began with a crushing defeat. Even armed with the deadly blade, Genichiro was no match for our honed skill. In a final, desperate act to save Ashina, he initiated the Blade’s forbidden power, sacrificing his own life to resurrect his grandfather, Isshin, the Sword Saint, restored to the peak of his martial glory.

Isshin erupted from Genichiro’s remains, appearing in his youthful prime. Facing Ashina's undisputed strongest master in this final, destined duel was the ultimate challenge. Isshin was far stronger than any foe we had previously encountered.

He began the fight wielding a single katana with deadly, contained grace. But upon entering the second phase, his excitement was palpable; drawing a colossal spear and shouting, 'My blood is boiling!' His fighting style became a tempest of complexity, chaining together spear thrusts, sword strikes, and even fire-arm shots. In the third phase, the sky cracked with thunder, and Isshin himself deployed the devastating 'Lightning of Tomoe.'

Throughout the trial, his signature phrase echoed every time we failed: 'Hesitation is defeat.' This was more than a taunt—it was the core lesson of the game, demanding we embrace aggressive, proactive pressure.

The resurrected Isshin did not rise to repel the invading Interior Ministry. Perhaps he understood that the demise of Ashina was inevitable. He simply sought a magnificent, final duel with Wolf—a true Martial Artist  desiring nothing more than a worthy opponent. Upon his defeat, he accepted his fate with dignity, bidding me, 'Well done,' and demanding I finish the task.

Defeating the Sword Saint brought the long, tumultuous journey to its climactic end. As a player, the sense of accomplishment was immeasurable. I transformed from the shinobi who struggled with simple grunts into the warrior capable of overcoming Ashina’s greatest master. It was I, not Wolf, who truly achieved mastery and growth.
